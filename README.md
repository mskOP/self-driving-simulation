**Self-Driving Simulation Repository**
**Overview**
Welcome to the Self-Driving Simulation repository! This project is a simulation environment for experimenting with and developing self-driving car algorithms.
The simulation is built using JavaScript and employs a feed-forward algorithm to enable the virtual vehicle to navigate through various scenarios.

**Features**
**JavaScript**: The simulation is implemented using JavaScript, making it accessible and easy to work with for a wide range of developers.
**Feed-Forward Algorithm**: The core driving logic is based on a feed-forward algorithm. This algorithm allows the virtual car to make decisions and control its movements in real-time.
**Visualization**: A graphical interface provides real-time visualization of the virtual environment, allowing developers to monitor the behavior of the self-driving car and analyze its performance.
**Customization:** The simulation is designed to be highly customizable. Developers can easily modify parameters, add new scenarios, and experiment with different algorithms
                    to improve the performance of the self-driving system.
